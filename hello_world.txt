Welcome to the slowest website on Earth. 
We are so slow, in fact, that we don't even exist yet. 
Right now, we are in the primordial soup of the internet. 
But one day, we will make mundane comments about everything that happens on Earth, everywhere! 
The fun part is, we will meticulously, and unobjectively describe the mundane and the magnificent alike 
through data & statistics. See you then!"
